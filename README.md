Django website for my sister
============================

Written based on the requirements of her business as well as giving me the ability to code a django project from the ground up.

Stuff to do:
- Grunt/Bower instead of cdns.
- Allow portraits to re refreshed via management command.
- Create review pictures.
- Polish pages.
- Add footer.
