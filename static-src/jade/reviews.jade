                    p It is hard to finds words that are strong enough to express my thanks to you for yesterday. Every bride wants to look their best for their groom on their wedding day. Not only did you make me look beautiful, Orly, but I felt it! You are so professional and yet so personable, attentive and the way you listen to what your clients want is priceless. From the bottom of my heart, thank you

                    p Orly did an amazing job, she was a pleasure to have around, and provided a much needed calmness to a very hectic day! Orly was incredibly flexible and managed to make a group of very fussy ladies extremely happy with their make up, accommodating to each persons personal style.

                    p From the first phone call to arrange a makeup trial, I found a comfort in talk...ing to Orly. Orly is amazing. During the whole process she was completely supportive and rock and rolled with every request ensuring mine and my families comfort. Throughout numerous trials and ingredient discussions, Orly was professional and accommodating to ensure our satisfaction. Equally as amazing as her being so great to work with, is her makeup. As I am someone with little understanding of makeup, Orly was able to transform me into exactly what I had envisioned. She understands your face and makes you feel the way you should on your wedding day. I am very grateful I was given her number and truly honoured to be able to call her my good friend. I highly recommend her to anyone in need of an amazing makeup artist

                        | Hi Orly,
                        br
                        | I was absolutely thrilled to have my makeup done by you. I am so glad that you recommended me to wear false eyelashes because it really complimented my whole face. My eyes popped as you said it would and so many people told me that my makeup was beautifully done. I cried, smiled, laughed and my makeup lasted the whole night.

                    p Orly was great! She was very friendly and professional at the same time. She did my bridesmaids makeup my moms and my self. The products she used where really good they are water based so you dont get that heavy feeling when its on your skin and it stayed on all day and night!! I would recommend any bride to give orly a call. She provides a great service for a great price :)

                    p Orly was really great! Doesn't overcharge like some of the others out there, punctual, professional and good at what she does. Everybody looked great. Her accompanying hair associate (Shai Farzaneh) is simply fabulous with hair and they make a great team (though Shai is a tad bit disorganized in an artsy way).

                        | I came across Orly by a recommendation made by a friend. I found Orly's website and decided to give her a call. She was very professional and gave me all the information I needed. Orly and I scheduled a makeup trial the day of my bridal shower. Orly asked me questions based on my daily makeup use. She went for a very natural look and it looked fantastic. My guests absolutely loved it and I received an abundance of compliments. Right from the trial, I knew that I had to finalize my booking with her for the day of the wedding. On the big day, she was very punctual and same with her assistant, Vise. These two ladies worked their magic and all of us looked incredible. We received a lot of compliments and we thought that the two of them were very friendly and personable.

                        | I have already recommended Orly to a friend who also used Orly's services the day of her wedding. I will continue to recommend Orly to people that I know that will wed or have a special event in the near future. Thank you both ever so much for your talented work!!!

                    p Orly did the make up for myself and my bridal party for my wedding and did an amazing job. She was so sweet and very professional.

I would definitely reccomend Orly for make up for any occassion!

                    p Orly is an exceptional make up artist! She is extremely friendly and amazing at what she does!

I had compliments all night. Any future events I need make up done there is no doubt in my mind I would call or recommend orly. I cannot thank her enough for making me look and feel like a princess on my wedding day!

                        | From the start, Orly was very professional and responsive. She came to the venue and completed the make-up for seven people quickly but didn't scrimpt on quality! My bridesmaids, my mom & mother-in-law were all very happy with her work. Orly even went to my mother-in-law's hotel room to make it more comfortable for her.

                    p Orly was very professional but still friendly and made me comfortable about having her do my makeup on my wedding day. She did a fantastic job and all of my bridesmaids, along with my mom and aunt were thrilled with her work and we all received compliments on our makeup all day long. Not only did she come to my house on time and with all of her products, but she was super friendly, she did a great job, she put everyone at ease, and she worked in a timely manner. I would highly recommend Orly to other brides, she was my favourite vendor and I know my family and friends will be using her for future weddings!

                        | Orly was fantastic and I couldn't be happier with the service she provided for my bridesmaids, mother and I. From the moment I contacted her she was professional and informative. She would respond quickly to any questions I had. My bridesmaids and I are pretty flexible and easy going, so it was easy for Orly to work with us. She always made sure we felt comfortable and if we required a change she was more than happy to modify our make-up. I didn't have to touch up my make up except my lipstick. The value I found was great for trial and day of wedding compared to some prices I came across.

                    p Orly was extremely professional and easy to work with. If you're looking for a flawless lasting look for your special event or wedding, she's definitely worth the price. She comes on time, works quickly and efficiently and I was extremely happy with the results. She did my makeup for my wedding and also my mom's makeup. We have nothing but the best to say about working with her.

                    p Orly was amazing and really did a spectacular job on our makeup. I've hired her three times now and have confidently recommended her to other brides as well. She's wonderful and she made a recommendation for an equally great hair stylist as well. We were thrilled and it showed in the pictures! :)
